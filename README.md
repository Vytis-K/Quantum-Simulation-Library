# Quantum Simulation Package

This is a quantum simulation package. Currently a work in progress.

Provides quantum walk for Fourier, Grover, and Hadamar coins, as well as visualizations and a basic GUI.

Has basic outline for machine learning methods and network, as well as multidimensional and higher dimensional walks, as well as entangled walks.
